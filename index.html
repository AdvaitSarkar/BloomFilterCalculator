<h2>A tiny introduction to Bloom filters</h2>
<p>A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that can be used to test whether an item is a member of a set (read more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>For each item you'd like to "store" in the set, you apply k different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash functions</a> to the item. Each of these k hashes should produce a number from 1 to m, which can be used as an index into a bit array of length m. Each of the k positions within the bit array are set to 1.</p>
	
<p>In order to test whether an item is a member of the set, the same k hash functions are used to generate array indices from this item. If any of these positions in the bit array is <em>not</em> set to 1, the item is definitely not part of the set. If all of the positions are set to 1, then the item <em>may</em> be part of the set with certain probability, but there is a chance that it may not be, because those indices might have been set to 1 as a result of some other items being added to the set. The Bloom filter therefore trades off the space required to store an entire set for exact set membership queries, for a small quantifiable likelihood of false positives.</p>

<p>This calculator uses the following formulae to calculate the probability that a query of a Bloom filter erroneously claims that an element is in the set. The formula on the left hand side is exact; the formula on the right is an approximation.

<h2>September 2020: a small caveat</h2>
<p>I have recently become aware that the above expression slightly underestimates the error rate in practice. This is because Bloom's original derivation for the expression assumes that each of the k hashes selects a <em>distinct</em> position in the bit array, an assumption which is not guaranteed in most implementations. That is to say, even if you have k indepedent hashes, you usually do not have the property that running them on a given output will produce k distinct array indices.</p>
	
<p><a href="https://gopiandcode.uk/logs/log-bloomfilters-debunked.html">A recent computer-aided proof</a> has shown that the correct expression for error rate in a bloom filter where hash outputs overlap is in fact:</p>

<p>In most cases, Bloom's original error rate expression is still useful for parameter tuning, as it is asymptotically consistent with the updated definition. Practical filters will have a bit array of vastly higher size than the number of hash functions used (that is, m >> k), making the probability of coincident indices negligible.</p>
